If you want to edit CSS, you'll need to install [sass](https://sass-lang.com/install) (command line) first. After you've made your changes to the SASS files, you need to compile them using the following commands in the root directory :
`$ ./sass-compile.cmd`
if it doesn't work, use
`$ sass-compile.cmd`
